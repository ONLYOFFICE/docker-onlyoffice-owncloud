## Document Server and ownCloud Docker installation

Document Server (distributed as ONLYOFFICE Docs starting from version 6.0) and ownCloud Docker installation will install the preconfigured version of [ONLYOFFICE Document Server][2] connected to ownCloud to your server running them in Docker containers.


## Requirements

* The latest version of Docker (can be downloaded here: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/))
* Docker compose (can be downloaded here: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))


## Installation

1. Get the latest version of this repository running the command:

    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docker-onlyoffice-owncloud
    cd docker-onlyoffice-owncloud
    git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
    ```

2. Run Docker Compose:

    **Please note**: the action must be performed with **root** rights.

    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    **Please note**: you might need to wait a couple of minutes when all the containers are up and running after the above command.

Now you can enter ownCloud and create a new document. It will be opened in ONLYOFFICE Document Server.
